I am a current PhD student studying Urban Planning at the University of Calgary. My scholastic background includes a MA, Planning from the University of Waterloo and a BA, Geography (Distinction) from the University of Regina. I am a Full Member (MCIP) in the Canadian Institute of Planners and a Registered Professional Planner (RPP). As a planner I have practiced in roles in both the public and private sectors. 

I have long been interested in the economic, social, and environmental issues that encompass our urban environment. I am particularly engaged in the areas of Smart Growth, creating vibrant, walkable and socially inclusive communities, and planning and design as it relates to the downtown context.
