Hi! Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet. I am a City/Urban Planner currently based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I am a Full Member (MCIP) and a Registered Professional Planner (RPP) in the Canadian Institute of Planners (CIP), and the Alberta Professional Planners Institute (APPI). Presently, I am a PhD Candidate in Planning at the [University of Calgary](http://ucalgary.ca). Previous to this I received my MA, Planning from the [University of Waterloo](http://www.uwaterloo.ca) and a BA, Geography (Distinction) from the [University of Regina](http://www.uregina.ca).

Through my professional experiences, I have been fortunate to practice in both the public and private sectors. My roles and responsibilites have been diverse, spanning across various sub-disciplines of planning. 

I've long been interested in the economic, social, and environmental issues that encompass our urban environments. I enjoy exploring new destinations while also striving to be an active and engaged citizen wherever I call home.

Please don't hesitate to reach out! I enjoy hearing from others who share similar interests or who can provide commentary or feedback on my work. As well, I am available by email regarding employment or research opportunities.
