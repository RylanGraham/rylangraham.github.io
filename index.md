Greetings! I am an Urban Planner based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. In my current role, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Westman Centre for Real Estate Studies](https://haskayne.ucalgary.ca/westman-centre) and a Sessional Instructor in the [School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape](https://sapl.ucalgary.ca) at the [University of Calgary](http://ucalgary.ca). Previous to this, I completed a PhD at the [University of Calgary](http://ucalgary.ca), a Master of Arts (Planning) from the [University of Waterloo](http://www.uwaterloo.ca) and a Bachelor of Arts (Geography) with Distinction from the [University of Regina](http://www.uregina.ca). I am also a Full Member (MCIP) and a Registered Professional Planner (RPP) in the Canadian Institute of Planners (CIP), and the Alberta Professional Planners Institute (APPI). 

My research interests centre around the issues of growth management, downtown revitalization and neighbourhood change, plan evaluation, and with a particular interest in mid-sized Canadian cities.

Please don't hesitate to reach out for more information!
