I have been fortunate to study at a number of universities across Canada. These opportunities have provided a broader understanding of planning in the Canadian context. My educational background is as follows:

| Degree        | University | Location        | Year |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:---------| --------:|
| Bachelor of Arts, Geography (Distinction) | University of Regina | Regina, Saskatchewan | 2004 - 2009 |
| Master of Arts, Planning | University of Waterloo | Waterloo, Ontario | 2010 - 2012 |
| PhD, Planning | University of Calgary | Calgary, Alberta | In progress |


####My current research interests within planning largely centre around the following issues:

* Growth management through intensification
* Downtown and inner-city planning and revitalization
* Urban design as it relates to the interface of the public and private realms
* Comparative urban policy
* Canadian cities with a particular interest in the mid-sized city
